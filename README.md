# MAKISIG RESCUE 3121 EMERGENCY ALERTING APP WITH GIS MAPPING & TRACKING SYSTEM (2019)

**Capstone Project**

MAKISIG RESCUE 3121 is an emergency alerting system designed to enhance response time and coordination for health and emergency volunteers. It is composed of two main components:

- **Laravel-based Web Application** for managing and monitoring emergency alerts.
- **Android Application** that allows users to send their real-time location during emergencies.

The system uses **Google Firebase Realtime Database** for live location updates and **Leaflet.js** for interactive GIS mapping.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is no longer maintained and serves as an archive of my early work.
